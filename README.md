## Starting Point
**Date:** 31/01/2024  
**Brief:**  
To initiate the project, I first prepared a website evaluation report and conducted a meeting with the Community Alliance Trust to gather a development requirements brief. Both of these steps were essential in creating the following fields, which adhere to the standards of major project planning and workflow.

Below is a list of documentation created to finalise and agree upon the Scope, Timescale, Cost, Development, and Maintenance:
1. Website Evaluation Report
2. Development Requirements Report
3. Website Requirements Specification
4. Website Design Specification
5. Project Password-Protected Details
6. Hosting and Domain Pricing Report

## Website & Database Setup
**Date:** 03/02/2024  
**Brief:**  
Once all paperwork was discussed and agreed upon, I began to create the HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, and PHP framework to develop the website with database-driven content. This ensured that when I introduced the database table to the CMS framework, all components were easily integrated together.

Below is my preferred workflow for this phase, which helps maintain project control and compatibility:
1. Website Views Databases and create admin database users
2. Website Framework and image design/creation
3. Insert Website Database content and set up Database Connection
4. Create a post-cleaning script, selection script, and a secure HTTPS folder
5. Insert and integrate PHP code with the database content into each page
6. Create a contact form and emailing system
7. Conduct incremental testing for functionality, non-functionality, user-friendliness, purposeful content, copyrights, and browser/server compatibility

Once these steps were completed, I conducted an in-house alpha testing phase with three participants. The hosting and domain setup were deferred until a working demo was available for the client to verify requirements and provide feedback.

## CAT Blog System
**Date:** 07/02/2024  
**Brief:**  
The blog system was developed to allow users to view the latest news/events. A posting form was placed in the reserved homepage area, created using HTML, Bootstrap, and PHP. User inputs are sanitised and verified through HTML validation, PHP filters, and PDO blind variables for security.

The tasks completed during this phase included:
1. Posting form and database creation
2. Full cleaning and sanitising of user inputs
3. Creation of insertion, selection, and display scripts
4. Integration of the form into the website layout
5. Running a full test sequence for layout and functionality
6. Incremental testing after rendering testing was complete
